FreeFlash (Writable Flash)
==========================

Ported to the Firmware 3.55 by Rancid(o)

FreeFlash is a PS3 application that creates a new and writable flash device
called "dev_fflash". The original "dev_flash" device is kept to avoid issues.

We do NOT take any responsibilities for the wrong use of this application.
